### LoF_variant_assoc_test_part9.R
The purpose of this code is to test the loss of function rare variants in the sequenced individuals for association with handgrip strength.

### heritability_calculation_part1.R
The purpose of this code is to determine if handgrip strength is heritable in the population.

### plink_samplecode.txt
This file provides examples of plink code used to test for Hardy-Weinburg Equilibrium, association with phenotypic traits, and calculate minor allele frequency.
